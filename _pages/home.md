I develop quantitative risk and pricing models for banking and Fintech lending, currently exploring applications of cutting edge artificial intelligence, machine learning, and modern data engineering technologies to make these functions better, faster, and more reliable. For the last six years, I've been doing this work at Sunlight Financial, applying these technologies, tools, and models to consumer credit in the residential solar and home improvement industries.

I am also a world champion kickboxer after winning the WKA World Championship tournament in 2022.

To rip off [patio11](https://www.kalzumeus.com/), I solve business problems, and occasionally some data gets analyzed.

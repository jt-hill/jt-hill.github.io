Welcome to the home page for J.T. Hill. 

My professional background is in Credit Risk, Data Analytics, and Business Intelligence. Currently, I'm most interested in the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Data Engineering technologies to making these functions better, faster, and more reliable. 

If this is something you're interested in, [email me](mailto:jth@jt-hill.com) or follow one of the other links in the sidebar to get in touch!

To rip off [patio11](https://www.kalzumeus.com/), I solve business problems, and occasionally some data gets analyzed.

A full-stack quant - I develop and deploy quantitative risk and pricing models
for fintechs, banks, and other lending institutions. For the last six years,
I've been doing this at [Sunlight
Financial](https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/window-modern-loan-origination/),
applying machine learning, modern data engineering, and AI to consumer credit
in residential solar and home improvement lending.

I'm the creator of [credkit](https://github.com/jt-hill/credkit), an open
source library for loan and credit modeling in Python.

I'm also a 2022 WKA world champion kickboxer.

To rip off [patio11](https://www.kalzumeus.com/): I solve business problems,
and occasionally some data gets analyzed.

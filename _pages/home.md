I develop quantitative risk and pricing models for banking and Fintech lending,
currently exploring applications of cutting edge artificial intelligence,
machine learning, and modern data engineering technologies to make these
functions better, faster, and more reliable. For the last six years, I've been
doing this work at Sunlight Financial, applying these technologies, tools, and
models to consumer credit in the residential solar and home improvement
industries.

I am the creator and maintainer of
[credkit](https://github.com/jt-hill/credkit), a library to provide more
ergonomic primitives for loan and credit modeling in Python.

I am also a world champion kickboxer after winning the WKA World Championship
tournament in 2022.

If any of this is interesting to you, [email me](mailto:jth@jt-hill.com) or
follow one of the other links in the sidebar to get in touch!

To rip off [patio11](https://www.kalzumeus.com/), I solve business problems,
and occasionally some data gets analyzed.
